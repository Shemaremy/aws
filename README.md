## AWS Wrapper explanation
--------------------------

0. Compute, Storage, Database, Networking 
- Compute (EC2): Processing power 
- Storage (S3): Like storing product images
- Databases (RDS): Like storing  customers and products info
- Networking (VPC): Servers and databases to communicate securely and efficient

1. AWS Management Console (purpose, features, structure(widgets), launch, billing considerations)
- Payment modals (Pay as you go, Save when you commit, Pay less using more)
- Eat candy and pay, Buying candy jar at discount, Buying leftover extra candy
- Instances and managing regions
- Availability zones




2. AWS Storage (Intro, types)
- Intro to S3
- On-premises storage (hosted on site or locally)
- Cloud storage (Data is accessed using internet using aws)

- Block storage (Hosting databases, Analytics, Availability and Durablity)
- Object storage (Disaster recovery, Less needed data, Cloud native apps)
- File storage

- EBS: Block storage designed for EC2 instances
- EFS: Lets you share file systems across multiple EC2 instances. It's like a shared network drive in the cloud
- S3: Object storage designed to store massive amounts of data in the cloud.



3. AWS Compute
4. Databases
5. Serverless

6. Working with user data
7. Logging into a Linux EC2 Instance Using Amazon EC2 Instance Connect









## Suggested Learning Path
--------------------------

1. Start with basic AWS services like EC2, S3, and IAM.
2. Learn deployment processes for Node.js apps.
3. Gradually explore advanced services like CloudWatch, Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling.
4. Use the AWS Free Tier to practice without incurring costs.







## Basics
---------

- Backend services are more of: Computation (CPU), Networking (Ram) and Storage (Databases)



## List of popular services
---------------------------

1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): servers in the cloud that always run
2. Lambda: servers in cloud that run based on requests made
3. ECS (Elastic Container Service)
4. S3 (Simple Storage Service): Scalable object storage for data
5. EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block storage for use with EC2.

6. DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database
7. CodeDeploy: Automated deployment to EC2 or Lambda
8. CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster content delivery.
9. Route 53: Register domains and manage DNS records.
10. Certificate Manager: Free SSL/TLS certificates for domains.

11. Elastic Beanstalk: Platform as a Service (PaaS) for deploying web applications.
12. Lightsail: Simplified VPS for hosting websites and applications.
13. IAM (Identity and Access Management): backend service that allows you to securely manage access to AWS services and resources.
